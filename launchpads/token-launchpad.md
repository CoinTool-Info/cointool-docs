# How to claim tokens

After participating and purchasing pre-sale tokens, the next step is to claim your tokens.

If the hard cap has been reached, or the soft cap pre-sale is over, and the project has already launched, you can claim your tokens when the "Claim Private Sale" button becomes available.

MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee you need to pay for the transaction. If you agree, click the "Confirm" button to complete the process.

Check your wallet balance to see pre-sale tokens. We recommend that you follow the project's social media channels to see their updates.

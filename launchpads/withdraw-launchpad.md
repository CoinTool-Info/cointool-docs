# How to withdraw your donation

After participating and purchasing pre-sale tokens, if the soft cap has not been reached, you will need to wait until the end of the pre-sale to withdraw your contribution.

In this case, you can withdraw your contribution (BNB/ETH/KCC/AVAX) by clicking the "Withdraw Contribution" button.

MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee you need to pay for the transaction. If you agree, click the "Confirm" button to complete the process.

Check the balance of your wallet to see if the BNB is back.
